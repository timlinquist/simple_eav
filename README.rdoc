= simple_eav

simple_eav provides a simpler alternative to {acts_as_eav_model}[https://github.com/visfleet/acts_as_eav_model] that works with 
ActiveRecord without any monkey patching needed.  Acts_as_eav_model's gives a 
model the ability to have any number of custom attributes.

This project has the same goal.  The difference being maintaining utmost 
compatibility with ActiveRecord::Base.


== Installation
  gem install simple_eav

== Contributing

* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a
  future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history.
  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a
  commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
